# PortfolioProject
this is a portfolio project in this project i have used html and css.
Starting with navbar new design function i have added in this is changing colour of anchor tag on hovering upon it.
In the main section i have designed the layout using flexbox.
Other sections layout also used flexbox and for image alignment i have used position property.
Apart from the html other sources i used is color hunt for deciding the colur pallete, google fonts for importing font and shutterstock for the images.
